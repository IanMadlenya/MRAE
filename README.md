    "# Welcome\n",
    "**This 3-month project aims at detecting and utilizing mean-reverting phenomenon with machine learning techniques.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The code directory provides everything to perform the implementation of mean-reverting portfolios from scratch, meaning from data retrieval, to machine learning utilization, and strategies set up.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a matter of size, only the clean file of log-returns appears in the clean data directory. Raw files may be provided upon request.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other necessary files are included in the various directories, including results plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Requirements\n",
    "* Python 2.7 (see https://www.continuum.io/downloads)\n",
    "* Keras (see https://keras.io for a step-by-step install guide)\n",
    "* Mingw\n",

    "# Scripts description\n",
    "Scripts are described in the chronological/logical order they have been used\n",
    "* [marketData](./code/marketData.ipynb)\n",
    "    * Describe data formatting process, and choices made in the project regarding raw data\n",
    "    * Standalone notebook which explains step by step process\n",
    "* [statsDesc](./code/statsDesc.ipynb)\n",
    "    * Quick statistics on returns. Basics + correlations between stocks\n",
    "    * Standalone notebook\n",
    "* [neuralNetwork_utils](./code/neuralNetwork_utils.py)\n",
    "    * Some utils useful to neural networks: data formatting and plotting functions\n",
    "    * Normally, no need to edit it (except for model improvement)\n",
    "* [neuralNetwork_smoothness](./code/neuralNetwork_smoothness.py)\n",
    "    * Smoothness implementation. See script for further details\n",
    "    * Normally, no need to edit it (except for model improvement)\n",
    "* [neuralNetwork](./code/neuralNetwork.py)\n",
    "    * Describe the neural network structure and all related steps (e.g. fitting, score saving, some plots)\n",
    "    * Normally, no need to edit it (except for model improvement)\n",
    "* [neuralNetwork_main](./code/neuralNetwork_main.py)\n",
    "    * Train the above network. Parameters may be edited upond needs !\n",
    "    * As for now, parameters in the script are parameters retained all along the project. They enable to train all the networks. It is easy just to train a single model: just avoid the loop.\n",
    "* [portfolio](./code/portfolio.py)\n",
    "    * Describe a portfolio and the useful flow to implement a strategy\n",
    "    * Normally, no need to edit it (except for model improvement)\n",
    "* [portfolio_main](./code/portfolio_main.py)\n",
    "    * Run the above portfolio. Parameters may be edited upond needs ! As for now, parameters in the script are the last parameters retained. See the script to know how to tune parameters.\n",
    "* [resultsAnalysis_utils](./code/resultsAnalysis_utils.py)\n",
    "    * A bunch of useful functions to plot results in a fashion way\n",
    "    * Normally, no need to edit it (except for model improvement)\n",
    "* [resultsAnalysis_dataLoading](./code/resultsAnalysis_dataLoading.py)\n",
    "    * Load hard data that are never edited\n",
    "    * Normally, no need to edit it (except for model improvement)\n",
    "* [resultsAnalysis_neuralNetwork](./code/resultsAnalysis_neuralNetwork.ipynb)\n",
    "    * Go through neural network results: statistics, plots, correlations, ...\n",
    "    * Standalone notebook\n",
    "* [resultsAnalysis_portfolio](./code/resultsAnalysis_portfolio.ipynb)\n",
    "    * Go through portfolio results: statistics, plots, correlations, ...\n",
    "    * Standalone notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "# Results\n",
    "Some results are already available as plots.\n",
    "\n",
